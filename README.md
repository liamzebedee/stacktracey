# stacktracey
Pretty highlighter/viewer for stacktraces from .NET. Uses React.js and XRegExp.

Helps with finding
 - where system code starts
 - where your code starts
 - more quickly understanding how different areas of the codebase interact, through colours and spatial reasoning (as opposed to reading massive walls of text)

The design and code could definitely be made nicer, this was just a little project.
